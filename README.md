# ðŸ¥« Groceries List in Phoenix

This is a simple Phoenix project to learn a little bit about the framework and Elixir. 

It consists of a groceries list in which you can:

- Add groceries (providing a name and quantity)
- Delete groceries
- Increment/decrement a grocery's quantity
- Mark a grocery in the list as complete 

## ðŸš€ How to run

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
